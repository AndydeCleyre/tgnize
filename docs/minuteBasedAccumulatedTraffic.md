## Accumulated Chat Traffic per Minute
Here we'd like to take a deeper look at how one chat participant has spent his/ her time over this period of time _( for which we're inspecting this Chat )_ in this Chat, at minute level detail.

### How to do so ?
- We've Chat data along with each message tagged with its corresponding time stamp _( time of sending message )_, which will be extracted & one frequency holder is to be built
- Now our job is easy, we can simply plot this dataset,
and create one animated plotting, depicting accumulated chat activeness by minute

- Time to do same for all participants of Chat. I've already run this script on our test data _( exported chat of Devs Chat telegram group )_, and the results are pretty interesting.

**Plots coming soon ...**
